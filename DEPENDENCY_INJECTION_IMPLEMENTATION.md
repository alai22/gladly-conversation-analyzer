# Dependency Injection Implementation

## Overview

Successfully implemented a service container pattern for dependency injection across the application. This refactoring makes services easily testable and removes tight coupling between routes and service instantiation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Service Container (`backend/core/service_container.py`)

The `ServiceContainer` class manages the lifecycle of all services:
- **Lazy initialization**: Services are created only when first requested
- **Singleton-like behavior**: Same service instance is returned on subsequent requests
- **Dependency resolution**: Automatically resolves service dependencies (e.g., `ConversationService` depends on `StorageService`)
- **Testing support**: Services can be overridden with mock instances for testing

### 2. Updated Application Entry Point (`app.py`)

- Added global service container instance
- Implemented Flask `before_request` hook to inject container into request context via `g`
- Services are now available to all routes through Flask's `g` object

### 3. Refactored All Route Files

Updated the following route files to use dependency injection:
- `backend/api/routes/claude_routes.py`
- `backend/api/routes/conversation_routes.py`
- `backend/api/routes/rag_routes.py`
- `backend/api/routes/health_routes.py`

**Before:**
```python
# Module-level service instantiation
claude_service = ClaudeService()

@claude_bp.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def claude_chat():
    # Direct use of module-level service
    response = claude_service.send_message(...)
```

**After:**
```python
@claude_bp.route('/chat', methods=['POST'])
def claude_chat():
    # Get service from container (injected via Flask's g)
    service_container = g.get('service_container')
    claude_service = service_container.get_claude_service()
    response = claude_service.send_message(...)
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Testability**
- Services can be easily mocked by overriding them in the container
- No need to patch module-level variables
- Isolated unit tests for each service

### 2. **Loose Coupling**
- Routes no longer directly instantiate services
- Services don't know about their consumers
- Easy to swap implementations

### 3. **Dependency Management**
- Dependencies are resolved automatically
- Clear dependency graph (Storage → Conversation → RAG)
- Services are initialized in correct order

### 4. **Lifecycle Management**
- Services are created once and reused
- Proper cleanup support with `reset()` method
- Memory efficient

## Usage Examples

### In Routes (Automatic Injection)
```python
from flask import g

@bp.route('/endpoint')
def endpoint():
    service_container = g.get('service_container')
    service = service_container.get_service()
    # Use service...
```

### In Tests (Manual Override)
```python
from backend.core.service_container import ServiceContainer
from unittest.mock import Mock

def test_route():
    container = ServiceContainer()
    mock_service = Mock()
    container.get_service(override=mock_service)
    
    # Test route with mocked service
```

## Service Dependencies

```
StorageService
    ↓
ConversationService ──┐
                       ↓
ClaudeService ──────────┴──→ RAGService
```

## Files Changed

- ✅ `backend/core/__init__.py` (new)
- ✅ `backend/core/service_container.py` (new)
- ✅ `app.py` (updated)
- ✅ `backend/api/routes/claude_routes.py` (refactored)
- ✅ `backend/api/routes/conversation_routes.py` (refactored)
- ✅ `backend/api/routes/rag_routes.py` (refactored)
- ✅ `backend/api/routes/health_routes.py` (refactored)

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
python test_service_container.py
```

All tests should pass, confirming:
- Service container creation
- Service retrieval
- Dependency resolution
- Service instance reuse

## Next Steps

1. **Add unit tests** for each service using dependency injection
2. **Refactor download routes** to use service container (optional)
3. **Add service interfaces** for even better testability (future enhancement)

## Notes

- Services are still compatible with their existing constructors
- No breaking changes to service APIs
- Backward compatible with existing code
- Can be extended to support more services easily
