Subject: Request for AWS S3 + EC2 Access - Gladly Conversation Analysis Tool

Hi [IT Team/Manager Name],

I'm requesting AWS access to deploy a customer conversation analysis tool for our team.

## What We Need
- **S3 bucket** for conversation data (~50MB)
- **EC2 instance** to host the web app
- **IAM permissions** for read/write access

## EC2 Instance Options
- **t3.micro**: 1GB RAM, 10% CPU baseline, ~$8/month (free tier eligible)
- **t3.small**: 2GB RAM, 20% CPU baseline, ~$15/month (better performance)

## Business Value
- Make tool accessible to entire team
- Centralized data storage
- Estimated cost: $10-20/month

## Security
- Read/write access to conversation data only
- Data is already anonymized
- All processing happens locally

## Questions
1. Do we have existing AWS accounts to use?
2. Any specific naming conventions?
3. Who should I work with for AWS setup?

The tool is built and working locally - just need cloud infrastructure.

Thanks!

[Your Name]
