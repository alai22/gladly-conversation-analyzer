 The collars were constantly corrected out pets even when they were in the middle of the containment area. These collars basically terrorized our pets. 
 My biggest gripe is i specifically asked about my concerns of lack of service at the remote cabin. I was assured that even with poor cell service the collars would work fine off of blue tooth. Not the case for me. The collars never performed properly for us.

That was easy; my dog was trained and when the collar actually worked, everything was fine. The problem was the gps signal/accuracy was not consistent. Sometimes my dog would be in an open location well inside the boundary with no obstructions and the collar would randomly give emergency feedback. This unexpected feedback when it was not appropriate confused my dog. This happened so often that I got advice from the dog park more than once to adjust the feedback threshold. After adjusting the threshold, the problem happened less often, but it still happened. Other times (quite often) the collar would lose gps signal among the trees in our yard (or the signal was so low that feedback was suspended), so our dog could pass beyond the boundary with no feedback. We were actually using our 2nd collar because the first one quit working while still under warranty. We've not had the 2nd one a year, but it never worked as well as the first (before the first one stopped working, that is). For all the money I've spent on the collar and the subscription, I'm very dissatisfied. If there was any way to get a refund or even a partial refund, I'd do it.

I tried to give it a good chance before giving up, but it just kept malfunctioning - even after talking to your support staff and getting firmware updates etc.  I will never recommend this to anyone and will tell anyone I can that this collar does not work.

The collar worked well with initial training. However, the unreliable and inconsistent nature of the GPS made it difficult to monitor Bo in a safe manner. The feedback was confusing for him while he was inside the boundary. The pin would periodically locate him outside the boundary and he would receive feedback to tell him he was outside the boundary. Often times my phone and the collar would lose communication...while I would be in eyesight of Bo. It got to the point he didn't want to put the collar on anymore. Lastly, the collar was unusable when we would go to the park and try and use cellular to engage the collar. This was not possible/not available, due I believe to the fact that we don't have AT&T cell plans here on the island. Your collar really is only good for customers in the US. This is a great product and I really wanted to work for us. Perhaps when/if you upgrade your product to include foreign countries, I would consider returning.

I am writing regarding the replacement Halo collar I received just over a year ago. Unfortunately, this collar is now experiencing an LTD chip issue that causes constant vibrations. This behavior has distressed my dog, leading me to remove the collar entirely.

Given that this is the second collar I‚Äôve had to replace, I am concerned about the product's durability and reliability. That is why we have canceled our service.

Best regards,
Sharon Mattson

The thing is, we didn't need it for the larger dog as he does not venture away from us or our property.  That is why we haven't used either.  Then there is the issue of the auto-renewal.  Our card was replaced so the auto renewal did not work. I got an email from you all  stating as such.  I informed you all in writing that we were not going to renew and why.

I contacted halo support numerous times and had numerous sessions in the halo dog park. Each time I was told there was either some software change and upgraded the collars with this new software or replace the collar entirely or some sensitivity was altered. Each time this happens, I diligently retrained the dogs.
 Unfortunately, yet consistently, the GPS would be so far off that my dogs would never be able to learn the boundaries because the boundaries were not consistent despite the numerous attempted fixes. I fell beyond the 90 day return window and was unable to return these collars a refund. 

In manual testing with collar in hand, I would be 15 feet over boundaries edge before the collar would alert that I was too close to the edge and when I attempted to walk back, the collar the GPS was so inaccurate that it would deliver a corrective feedback even when I was physically solidly within the safe zone boundary. 

I also have contacted halo numerous times regarding cancellation and pro rating my subscription plan that I paid for a full year of. Nobody has ever been able to prorate this plan and give me a refund. I was stuck with inoperable collars on dogs that were very used to using electric fences and responding appropriately to collar auditory notifications. 

I am overwhelmingly disappointed with my halo experience and had to go to another brand. I‚Äôve attempted to give every opportunity for Halo to help me and have been left holy unsatisfied if there is any way to rectify the situation and help me recoup some of my exuberant expense that I poured into this system, please let me know. Having tried numerous times without any response at all, I won‚Äôt hold my breath. I feel swindled and disappointed.","GPS and Location Accuracy Issues",Yes,Mixed,"American Staffordshire Terrier","6-8 years","71-100 lbs",Amazon,,"Action performed",,,aallen@halocollar.com,,,,nja7d71v6l98,,,,b60e5e4e-9c4d-4043-a8b8-63913aff04da,

It was so-so when he was in the boundary but if he ran across it the gps lagged and I don't know that he got shocked often. Then once he was out of boundary, it would not pick him up. That is when I needed to find him most. Our dog has a very high prey drive so I can understand the certain situations where this collar is not going to contain him, but it should be able to find him when he runs through.  There were also many times the collar delivered zero warnings or shocks as he crossed a boundary, then just never connected again once he was through.  Very frustrating when we are paying monthly for this service.  We went back to only having him out on a tie out if we are not outside with him.

I mean come on you can go buy a cheap collar of similar use from Walmart for a third of the cost and the battery last longer than that! Other than the issue with the battery I was really impressed and amazed at how well the collar worked, the many functions and settings it had, it was well put together and was one of the best training type collars I have you ever used. I am a reputable dog trainer and have done obedience training for over 10 years now and have been training dogs for duck hunting for over 7 years and have used many different types of training collars. If you could improve that battery life I wouldn‚Äôt mind paying the $500 for the collar because it would by far be the best on the market! I hope to see improvements with the halo collar in the future and maybe then I will give it another try!

The collar is wildly inaccurate. Even in clear skies, it won't read sometimes, reads really late other times (delayed reading by 5+ seconds) or completely misreads where my dog when she's is well within the boundaries and gives her feedback sitting in the middle of the yard. Today was the last straw with it as my dog WALKED down the street, in clear skies with no trees, beeping at her and not giving her any actual feedback to tell her she crossed the boundary lines. Kept getting notifications for warnings, not emergency feedback or anything. She nearly was hit by a car. After that happening, I lost all faith in the collar. Most of our yard does not have tree coverage, and where it does, it's not much. In the back yard where it is, it won't even register where she's at, and it's not even much for tree coverage either. It's just a bad system if it can't be accurate. I've check the app numerous times and it always shows it's at least 1500, if not 2000 on the strength of the collar.

When testing the collar, collar icon on app would suddenly go racing across the boundary zone, sometimes leaving the virtual fence area and then take a minute or more to slowly move back to the correct position. This product was highly unreliable and inaccurate and our dogs are much too precious to us to trust their safety to an unreliable containment system. I have no confidence in this product to trust it to protect our dogs. Due to the unreliability of the system, the only time our dogs had the collars on was for the initial fitting.

The only reason we put the collar on our dog is when she gets loose we have the GPS tracking however I can buy an Apple tile it does the same thing without all the charging please review our reports and you will find signals not affecting the dog or alerting the dog.
