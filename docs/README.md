# Documentation Archive

This folder contains the original fragmented documentation files that have been consolidated into the main `README.md`.

## Files Moved Here

- `README_GITHUB.md` - Original GitHub-focused README
- `README_claude_api.md` - CLI usage documentation
- `QUICK_START.md` - Quick setup guide
- `AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md` - AWS-specific deployment instructions
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - General deployment guide

## Current Documentation

All documentation has been consolidated into the main `README.md` file in the project root, which now includes:

- Quick start guide
- Development setup
- Usage modes
- Deployment options (EC2, Docker, Lambda)
- CLI usage
- Troubleshooting
- Production considerations

## Why This Change?

The original documentation was fragmented across multiple files with overlapping content, making it difficult for users to find the information they needed. The consolidated `README.md` provides a single source of truth with all necessary information organized logically.
